The code is written in JS. 
The folder has 3 files.

Assets.json is the input file containing data about various 
categories such as Movies, Episodes, Seasons, etc.

Task is to return a json with Movie data with id, title and year.
Group the data by FSK rating and sort with the same.

Clone the project and run 'node app.js' in cmd from the root folder.

This will transorm the json and create new file called movieAssets.json and write the output to that file.
